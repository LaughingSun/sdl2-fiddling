# sdl2-fiddling
Various exploits to test the boundaries of the unknown and undocumented.  Talking about SDL2 (two, number 2, not the same as number one or 1.2)

This project was developed on Ubuntu15 (linux) and includes a Makeflle that will build all, one sub-directory or a single project.  I may add cmake, windows and mingw support later if I have the time and no other distractions.  Feel free to make requests or suggestions on those or other ideas.

Basically clone or download/unpack the project and run "make" from the base directory to build it all.

requirements:
+ SDL2 library
+ GL library
+ gcc or other similar compiler
